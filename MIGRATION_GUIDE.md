# 🚀 Safe Migration Guide: Neon → Supabase

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read This First!

You have **29.43 MB of valuable data** in Neon. This guide ensures **zero data loss** during migration.

---

## 📋 Pre-Flight Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] ✅ Access to Netlify dashboard
- [ ] ✅ Access to Supabase dashboard (https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pvzicicwxgftcielnm)
- [ ] ✅ Latest `.env` file with all credentials
- [ ] ✅ 30-60 minutes of uninterrupted time
- [ ] ✅ Good internet connection
- [ ] ✅ Backup of your entire project (just in case)

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

The migration script includes:

✅ **Automatic backup** - Creates JSON + SQL dumps of all data
✅ **Non-destructive** - Doesn't delete anything from Neon
✅ **Verification** - Compares row counts after migration
✅ **Audit trail** - Generates detailed reports
✅ **Rollback capability** - Can restore from backups if needed
✅ **Batch processing** - Handles large datasets efficiently

---

## 🎯 Migration Steps (Recommended Order)

### Step 1: Audit (5 minutes)

**See what's in your Neon database:**

```bash
cd "/Users/aljosaursakous/Desktop/Flag football HTML - APP"
node scripts/migrate-neon-to-supabase.js --audit
```

**What this does:**
- Lists all tables
- Shows row counts
- Displays data size
- Reveals column structures
- Creates audit report in `backups/neon-migration/`

**What to look for:**
- Which tables have the most data
- If any tables are empty (can skip)
- Total rows to migrate

---

### Step 2: Backup (10 minutes)

**Create a complete backup:**

```bash
node scripts/migrate-neon-to-supabase.js --backup
```

**What this does:**
- Exports every table to JSON format
- Creates SQL INSERT statements
- Saves to `backups/neon-migration/backup-[timestamp]/`
- Generates metadata file

**Result:**
```
backups/neon-migration/backup-1733097600000/
├── metadata.json
├── users.json
├── users.sql
├── teams.json
├── teams.sql
├── games.json
├── games.sql
└── ... (all other tables)
```

⚠️ **KEEP THIS BACKUP!** Don't delete for at least 30 days.

---

### Step 3: Prepare Supabase (15 minutes)

**Ensure tables exist in Supabase:**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pvzicicwxgftcielnm

2. Go to **SQL Editor**

3. Check if these tables exist:
   - `users`
   - `teams`
   - `team_members`
   - `training_sessions`
   - `games`
   - `posts`
   - `tournaments`
   - `chat_messages`
   - `notifications`
   - `performance_metrics`
   - `wellness_data`

4. **If any table is missing**, the migration script will show you the CREATE TABLE SQL:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table_name (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     -- ... other columns
   );
   ```

5. Copy and run the SQL in Supabase SQL Editor

---

### Step 4: Migrate (20-30 minutes)

**Run the full migration:**

```bash
node scripts/migrate-neon-to-supabase.js --migrate
```

**What this does:**
1. Runs audit again
2. Creates backup (safety!)
3. Migrates data table by table
4. Shows progress for each table
5. Handles errors gracefully
6. Creates migration report

**Expected output:**
```

### Step 5: Verify (10 minutes)

**Confirm data integrity:**

```bash
node scripts/migrate-neon-to-supabase.js --verify
```

**What this does:**
- Counts rows in Neon
- Counts rows in Supabase
- Compares the counts
- Reports any discrepancies

**Expected output:**

ℹ Discrepancies: 0

🎉 All data verified successfully!
```

---

### Step 6: Test Application (15 minutes)

**Test with Supabase ONLY:**

1. **Temporarily disable Neon** in `.env`:
   ```bash
   # Comment out Neon
   # DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_...

   # Keep Supabase
   SUPABASE_URL=https://pvzicicwxgftcielnm.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJhbGci...
   ```

2. **Restart your dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test key features:**
   - [ ] Login/Register
   - [ ] Dashboard loads with correct data
   - [ ] Training sessions appear
   - [ ] Games show correct stats
   - [ ] Community posts visible
   - [ ] Real-time features work (if implemented)

4. **Check Netlify Functions logs:**
   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com/sites/webflagfootballfrogs/functions
   - Verify functions are using Supabase
   - No errors related to database connections

---

### Step 7: Update Production (10 minutes)

**If tests pass, update Netlify environment:**

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/webflagfootballfrogs/settings/deploys#environment

2. **Remove these variables:**
   - `DATABASE_URL` (Neon)
   - `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` (Neon)
   - `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` (Neon)
   - `VITE_DATABASE_URL` (if points to Neon)
   - `VITE_NEON_DATABASE_URL`

3. **Keep these variables:**
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
   - `JWT_SECRET`
   - `NODE_ENV`

4. **Trigger a new deploy:**
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Switch to Supabase only"
   git push
   ```

5. **Monitor the deploy:**
   - Check build logs
   - Test production site
   - Verify function logs

---

### Step 8: Clean Up Local Files (5 minutes)

**Update your local `.env`:**

```bash
# Remove these lines:
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:...
# VITE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:...
# VITE_NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:...

# Keep these:
SUPABASE_URL=https://pvzicicwxgftcielnm.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
NODE_ENV=development
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

**Update `.env.example`:**
```bash
# Remove Neon references
# Add comment: "We use Supabase for database"
```

---

### Step 9: Disable Neon Extension (30 days later)

**After 30 days of successful operation:**

1. Go to Netlify dashboard: Extensions → Neon
2. Click "Options" → "Disable extension"
3. Confirm you have backups
4. Delete the Neon database

⚠️ **Wait 30 days** to ensure everything works perfectly!

---

## 🚨 Alternative: One-Command Migration

**If you're confident and want to do everything at once:**

```bash
node scripts/migrate-neon-to-supabase.js --full
```

This runs: audit → backup → migrate → verify

**Use this if:**
- ✅ You've read this entire guide
- ✅ You have time for the full process
- ✅ You're comfortable with command-line tools

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan (If Something Goes Wrong)

If migration fails or data is incorrect:

### Option 1: Keep Using Neon
1. Re-enable Neon env vars in Netlify
2. Redeploy
3. Debug the issue
4. Try migration again later

### Option 2: Restore from Backup
```bash
# Your backup is in:
ls backups/neon-migration/backup-[timestamp]/

# Each table has JSON and SQL files
# You can manually import to Supabase if needed
```

### Option 3: Use Migration Script to Retry
```bash
# Re-run migration for specific tables
# (You can modify the script to target specific tables)
node scripts/migrate-neon-to-supabase.js --migrate
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Table does not exist in Supabase"

**Solution:**
1. Check the migration report for CREATE TABLE SQL
2. Copy the SQL statement
3. Run it in Supabase SQL Editor
4. Re-run migration

---

### Issue: "Row count mismatch"

**Possible causes:**
1. Data was modified during migration (stop writes first)
2. Duplicate prevention (upsert may skip duplicates)
3. Migration was interrupted

**Solution:**
1. Check verification report for details
2. Query both databases to compare
3. Re-run migration for that table

---

### Issue: "Connection timeout"

**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Neon database is still active
3. Check Supabase is not rate-limiting
4. Run migration during off-peak hours

---
