# FlagFit Pro React App

This is the React frontend for the FlagFit Pro application, migrated from Vue.js with comprehensive technical debt resolution.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/AJKous31/flagfit-pro-training-app)

**One-click deployment to Netlify with automatic configuration!**

### Manual Deployment Steps:
1. Click the "Deploy to Netlify" button above
2. Connect your GitHub account if prompted
3. Configure environment variables (optional):
   - `VITE_POCKETBASE_URL` - Your PocketBase backend URL
   - `VITE_APP_ENVIRONMENT` - Set to `production`
4. Click "Deploy site"
5. Your app will be live in 2-3 minutes! 🎉

### Alternative Platforms:
- **Vercel**: Currently experiencing module resolution issues
- **Railway**: Great for full-stack deployment with backend
- **GitHub Pages**: For static deployment only

## 🚀 Features

- **Authentication System**: Complete login/register functionality with JWT tokens
- **Training Management**: Track training sessions, goals, and progress
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking and performance metrics
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS
- **Modern Architecture**: React hooks, context API, and service layer pattern
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and comprehensive documentation

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React 18** with hooks and context API
- **React Router v6** for navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Custom hooks** for common functionality
- **Service layer** for API communication
- **ESLint & Prettier** for code quality

## 🏗 Architecture Decisions

### Context Pattern
- **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication state and token management
- **TrainingContext**: Handles training sessions, goals, and statistics
- **AnalyticsContext**: Tracks user behavior and performance metrics

### Service Layer
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses a service container for loose coupling
- **Caching**: Implements intelligent caching with TTL and pattern invalidation
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all services

### Custom Hooks
- **useStandardReducer**: Reduces boilerplate in context reducers
- **useForm**: Handles form state, validation, and submission
- **useLocalStorage**: Persistent state with cross-tab synchronization
- **useDebounce**: Debounced values for search inputs
- **useAsync**: Async operation handling with loading states
- **useOnlineStatus**: Network connectivity tracking

## 🔧 Technical Debt Resolution

### ✅ Completed Fixes

1. **Outdated Dependencies**
   - Added `"type": "module"` to package.json
   - Updated PostCSS configuration
   - Added ESLint and Prettier for code consistency

2. **Placeholder Logic**
   - Replaced cache hit rate placeholder with real implementation
   - Implemented proper dropoff rate calculation in analytics
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation

3. **Code Duplication**
   - Created `useStandardReducer` hook for context reducers
   - Created `useForm` hook for form handling
   - Extracted date utilities to reduce duplication

4. **Complex Functions**
   - Refactored streak calculation into utility functions
   - Split analytics calculations into smaller, testable functions
   - Improved cache service with better separation of concerns

5. **Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments
   - Updated README with architecture decisions
   - Added inline comments for complex logic

6. **Coding Standards**
   - Added ESLint configuration
   - Added Prettier configuration
   - Enforced consistent code style

### 📋 Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Add unit tests for utilities and hooks
- [ ] Implement error boundary improvements
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create component storybook
- [ ] Add TypeScript migration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix     # Fix ESLint issues
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check # Check code formatting
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
npm test             # Run tests (when implemented)
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
```
